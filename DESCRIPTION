Description: Tools for analyzing functional connectivity from fMRI data using 
    parcellated brain atlases. Designed to work with connectivity matrices 
    produced by the CONN toolbox. Functions support processing connectivity 
    matrices, calculating within-network and between-network connectivity metrics, 
    analyzing region-of-interest to network connectivity patterns, and integrating 
    connectivity measures with behavioral data. Supports flexible ROI definitions 
    and network assignments. Optimized for the Schaefer 7-network 100-parcel 
    atlas but adaptable to other parcellation schemes.
